# Backups

Store device configuration exports here, organised by device/platform.

Each subdirectory should contain dated exports, e.g.:
```
deco/
├── deco-config-2026-02-21-pre-migration.bin
└── deco-config-2026-02-21-post-migration.bin
```

## Pre-Migration Backups Needed
- [ ] Deco configuration export
- [ ] Home Assistant full snapshot
- [ ] Yealink configuration export
- [ ] Hikvision network settings (screenshot or export per device)
- [ ] Shelly device configs (if static IPs are set on device)
